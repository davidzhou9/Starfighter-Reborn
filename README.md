# Starfighter-Reborn

Starfighter: Reborn&quot; is a re-imagined classic arcade game for Android OS. The application was developed 
by Cypress Ranch High School student David Zhou in the 2015-2016 Computer Science Problems and Solutions class. 
This project was made possible with the help of mentors Mr. Bryce Hulett (Cypress Ranch) and Dr. Yonggao Yang 
(Prairie View A&amp;M University). The joystick was open source code from Github, user Ville Saarinen. The application 
was built in Android Studio and tested on a Samsung Galaxy S5. Any questions to the developer can be sent to
